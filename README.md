OpenGL and EGL registry API definition header files from Khronos Group.

This repository is intended to be used as a submodule for my opengl loading needs. As aforementioned these headers were retrieved from the [OpenGL-Registry](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/OpenGL-Registry) and [EGL-Registry](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/EGL-Registry) repos of [KhronosGroup](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/), in order to avoid cloning the documentation files from those repos.
